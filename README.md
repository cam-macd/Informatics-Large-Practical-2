In this repository, code is provided to control an autonomous drone which collects readings from air quality sensors around an urban geographical area. Below is an example of the drone's flight path around the University of Edinburgh's central area, provided by the drone control software.

See ilp-report for information of software architecture, class documentation, and the drone control algorithm.

See ilp-results for a large amount of sample flight paths. Geojson data can be read on [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/).
